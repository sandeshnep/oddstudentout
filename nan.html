    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>My name is Nan Xie. I’m intended to double major in business with a track in marketing and Computer Science. I am a first-year student at University of Rochester. I’m 19 years old and have 2 younger siblings. My brother is a freshman in Highschool and my sister is a one year old. I’m been running track for more than 10 years and I currently run for the school team. My favorite food is everything that’s edible. I eat anything and everything because I’m not a picky eater. I don’t have any pets, but I would really love a dog or a cat. 
    </p>

    <h2>Early Years</h2>

    <p>Even though I’ve not had any working experience, I’ve had some experience interning. My first ever internship was at the marketing department in a cosmetic company. Luckily, I was able to gain much experience throughout. I learned about how departments within the company interact with each other, understood the importance of maintaining a healthy relationship with my coworkers. The part of the internship that I disliked was that I had to wake up at 4 in the morning every day to get ready for work because I lived 40 miles away from my workplace.
    </p>

    <h2>School</h2>

    <p>I took four classes first semester in college. For the most part I was able to maintain a high GPA. Even though I didn’t do well in my Economics class, I was able to finish the semester with a 3.8. I’m taking five classes this semester and my goal is to have a 4.0 overall by the end of the semester. I’m planning on finish taking 36 classes by the time I graduate from U of R. This requires me overloading for 3 more semesters. I’m planning on taking music lessons from Eastman junior year because I’m really interested in learning guitar.
    </p>

    <h2>Sports</h2>


    <p>I also enjoy playing basketball a lot. Whenever thing is a pickup game going on in the gym, I am there. My childhood dream was to play pro-basketball. However, I was forced to give up that career path due to a serious ankle injury that I suffered from freshman year in High School. Then I gradually shifted my focus to track and working out. The challenge was to maintain a perfect body that I could maximize my speed when I run. Despite the difficulties, I was able to manage to have a body with less than 10 percent body fat with optimal strength output. I weigh 155 pounds and I’m able to bench press over 225 pounds and squad over 300 pounds. This is ideal for a runner because the goal for runners is to generate more power with less body weight. My speed increases as this ratio increases. By the end of my senior year in Highschool, I was able to compete at the NY state State meet. On top of that I graduated with a school record in the 200-meter dash.
