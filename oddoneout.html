        <h3 class="test"> Early Life </h3>
        <p>Graduated from IB programme in high school, I ended up in U of R as an international student. I chose Environmental Study instead of Environmental Science is because I’m not the type of person who can sit in lab for more than 5 hrs and study on the other hand, is more policy-wise and practices related which potentially suits me more. Besides, I’m really not a massive science nerd that can recite complicated equations like piece of cake.
        </p>
        <h3> Academic Program </h3>
        <p>My inclination for graduate program would be finance. There are 2 major reasons I convert from Environmental Study to Finance. First, my mom and dad initially wanted me to take econ and finance during college, and this is kind of my family business; but instead I went a little bit rebellious and independent and decided to try out the unpopular but fascinating earth science. The kind of major most Asian parents would classify it as “won’t get you a decent job in the future”. Second, my intern during last summer was to work for a Private Equity company. (P.E. is like high-end in the finance industry) And the experience is so amazing and I was able to see myself working for finance in the future.</p>
        <h3> Interests </h3>
        <p>My spare time hobby is really nerdy and geeky. I pretty much spend all my leisure time with my pc. I’m an editorial crew member for Gosugamer, and I am a very skilful dota2 player (top20 North America). This applies that I usually play video games(dota2) all day. Besides, I do music as well. I started doing covers and writing during high school but I stopped a while ago because I don’t see a good future doing this, but still, I’m a great singer.</p>
